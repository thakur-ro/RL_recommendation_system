## Reinforcement Learning based Recommendation System
To formulate the recommendation system as Markov Decision Process, we consider the Recommendation System as an Agent. The user interacts with the agent via environment, and obtains a reward and the new state. Our objective is to learn an Optimal Policy function using Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Method which can maximize cumulative rewards.
